>in the project i will try to relate mathematical function to functional programming. i will also cover some known principal about functional programming.
> For this project i will choose JVM based language, primarily Java and Kotlin. But later i will add Scala

# Functional Programming 
***
### Pillar of Functional Programming
1. Immutability  
2. Pure Function  
3. Higher OrderFunction
4. Referential Transparency
5. Recursion
***

## Immutability

**What does immutability stand for? Immutability is like a constant. But in deep unchangeable unmodifiable value. A variable whose value is always the same.**  
**let assume we have a mathematical function `x+y=5`**  
**sum of x and y will always be 5. so if i choose y=2, x will always 3**
