>In this project, I will attempt to establish a relationship between mathematical functions and functional programming, covering some of the well-known principles of functional programming. To accomplish this, I have chosen a JVM-based language, primarily Java and Kotlin

# Functional Programming 
> Functional programming focuses on specifying what should be done, rather than how to do it.

### Concept of Functional Programming
1. Immutability  
2. Pure Function  
3. Higher OrderFunction
4. Referential Transparency
5. Recursion
6. Functional Composition
7. First Class Function

## Immutability

**What does immutability stand for? Immutability is like a constant. But in deep unchangeable unmodifiable value. A variable whose value is always the same.**  
**let assume we have a mathematical function `x+y=5`**  
**sum of x and y will always be 5. so if i choose y=2, x will always 3**
