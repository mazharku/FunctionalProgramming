>In this project, I will attempt to establish a relationship between mathematical functions and functional programming, covering some of the well-known principles of functional programming. To accomplish this, I have chosen a JVM-based language, primarily Java and Kotlin
****
# Functional Programming 
> Functional programming focuses on specifying what should be done, rather than how to do it.

### Concept of Functional Programming
1. Immutability  
2. Pure Function  
3. Higher-order Function
4. Referential Transparency
5. Recursion
6. Functional Composition
7. First Class Function
