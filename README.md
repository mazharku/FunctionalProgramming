>In this project, I will attempt to establish a relationship between mathematical functions and functional programming, covering some of the well-known principles of functional programming. To accomplish this, I have chosen a JVM-based language, primarily Java and Kotlin
****
```
All code examples can be found in the 
specific language by searching for the package name

# What is Function?
```
 In short - A function relates an input to an output!
 Basically a function has three components
  1. Input
  2. Relationship
  3. Output
  
  A function may have name like f(x) = x^2. here `f` is the name 
  of the function and `x` is input.
  * Function must work for every possible input value.
  * Each input value can only have one output value.
  * Multiple input values can correspond to the same output value.

# Functional Programming 
> Functional programming focuses on specifying what should be done, rather than how to do it.

### Concept of Functional Programming
1. Immutability  
2. Pure Function  
3. Higher-order Function
4. Referential Transparency
5. Recursion
6. Functional Composition
7. First Class Function
